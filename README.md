# TuneStudio2560
#### ⚠  As of this moment TuneStudio2560 is still in pre-development and this README *DOES NOT* represent the complete version of this project and is likely missing information.
TuneStudio2560 is a song creator and playback interface made for the Arduino Mega 2560 microcontroller. The program and hardware allow users to create their own "tunes" in order to make a simple song by playing the noises from a passive buzzer connected to the microcontroller.
#### *For best compatibility it is recommended to open and upload the project using the [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) extension for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).*
## Features
- Ability to create different tunes using one of the five defined buttons and adjust their frequency using the potentiometer.
- Song saving persistence using EEPROM.
- Play back previously saved songs which are saved in EEPROM.
- Ability to add songs, remove songs, add tunes in songs and remove tunes from songs.
- Delete all saved songs (flush EEPROM) and start new.
- Text feed back on an LCD.
- RGB Led status indicator.

## Contributing & Suggestions
Extending TuneStudio2560 to other microcontrollers is still in consideration.\
For any software requests then feel free to request a pull. For any hardware requests you can either fork your own or message me but further expansion of hardware is unlikely.
